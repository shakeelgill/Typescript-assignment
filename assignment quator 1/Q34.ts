/*
 Pizzas: Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names 
in a array, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
â€¢ Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of 
printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output 
containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza
*/
